    <h2>The Ultimate Nigerian Jollof Rice: A Step-by-Step Guide (Heading 2)</h2>
    <p>Today, we're diving into the vibrant world of one of West Africa's most iconic and beloved dishes  Nigerian Jollof Rice. It's more than just food; it's a celebration, a symbol of festivity and hospitality. My recipe will guide you to create a fragrant, rich, and perfectly cooked Jollof that will have your guests asking for seconds!</p>
    <h2>Step by step instructions</h2>
    <p>1. Prepare Your Protein: Season your chicken/beef with salt, pepper, curry powder, and thyme. Brown it in a little oil, then set aside. You can also boil it until tender and use the stock.</p>

    <p>2. Make the Tomato Base:
  •  In a blender, combine tomatoes, bell peppers, Scotch Bonnets, garlic, ginger, and half of the red onion. Blend until smooth.
  •  In your large pot, heat the vegetable oil. Sauté the remaining sliced onion until softened.
  •  Add the tomato paste (if using) and fry for 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly. This deepens the flavor.
  •  Pour in the blended tomato mixture. Add bay leaves, curry powder, thyme, bouillon cubes, salt, and pepper. Simmer on medium heat for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens and the oil starts to separate. This is crucial for flavor!</p>

  <p>3. Wash the Rice: Thoroughly rinse your rice in cold water several times until the water runs clear. This removes excess starch and helps prevent the rice from clumping</p>
  <h5>This is heading 5</h5>
  <p>4. Combine & Cook:
  •  Add the rinsed rice to the simmering tomato sauce. Stir well to ensure every grain is coated.
  •  Pour in the broth (or water). The liquid should be about ½ to 1 inch above the rice.
  •  Add your browned protein (or its stock, if you boiled it).
  •  Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to the lowest setting.
  •  Cover the pot tightly with aluminum foil first, then with the lid. This creates a tight seal, trapping steam and ensuring even cooking.</p>

  <p>5. Simmer Gently: Cook on low heat for 25-35 minutes without lifting the lid. If the rice isn't fully cooked but the liquid has evaporated, add a splash of hot water (about ¼ cup) and continue cooking for another 5-10 minutes.</p>
  <p>6. Rest & Serve: Once cooked, turn off the heat and let the Jollof rice rest, still covered, for 10-15 minutes. This allows the steam to redistribute and makes the rice fluffier</p>
  <p>7. Fluff and Serve: Gently fluff the Jollof with a fork. Serve hot with fried plantains, coleslaw, or a side of your favorite grilled meat.</p>
